# Categories Delete Confirmation Dialog Fix

## Issue Description

In the manage categories screen, when clicking the delete button, the confirmation modal was displaying the actual function code as text instead of the proper confirmation message:

```
function () { console.log(`Deleting category ${code}`); categoryOperations.deleteCategory(code, description).then(result => { if (result.success) { console.log(`✅ Category ${code} deleted successfully`); populateCategorySelect(); populateCategoriesModal(); resolve(result); } else { reject(new Error('Failed to delete category')); } }).catch(error => { console.error('❌ Error deleting category:', error); reject(error); }); }

Are you sure you want to delete "Testing" from Mx. Voice permanently? All songs in this category will be changed to the category "Uncategorized."
```

## Root Cause

The issue was caused by a mismatch between the `customConfirm` function implementation and how it was being used:

1. **Promise-based `customConfirm`**: The actual implementation in `modal-utils.js` returns a Promise
2. **Callback-based usage**: The `deleteCategoryUI` function was trying to use it with a callback-style approach
3. **Function display**: This caused the callback function to be displayed as text in the modal instead of being executed

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/renderer/modules/categories/category-ui.js`

**Problem**: The `deleteCategoryUI` function was using callback-style `customConfirm`:

```javascript
customConfirm(
  `Are you sure you want to delete "${description}" from Mx. Voice permanently? All songs in this category will be changed to the category "Uncategorized."`,
  function () {
    // Callback function that was being displayed as text
  }
);
```

**Solution**: Updated to use async/await with Promise-based `customConfirm`:

```javascript
async function deleteCategoryUI(event, code, description) {
  event.preventDefault();
  
  try {
    // Use custom confirmation dialog
    if (typeof customConfirm === 'function') {
      const confirmed = await customConfirm(
        `Are you sure you want to delete "${description}" from Mx. Voice permanently? All songs in this category will be changed to the category "Uncategorized."`,
        'Delete Category'
      );
      
      if (confirmed) {
        console.log(`Deleting category ${code}`);
        
        const result = await categoryOperations.deleteCategory(code, description);
        if (result.success) {
          console.log(`✅ Category ${code} deleted successfully`);
          await populateCategorySelect();
          await populateCategoriesModal();
          return result;
        } else {
          throw new Error('Failed to delete category');
        }
      }
      // User cancelled
      return;
    } else {
      // Fallback to native confirm
      if (confirm(`Are you sure you want to delete "${description}" from Mx. Voice permanently? All songs in this category will be changed to the category "Uncategorized."`)) {
        console.log(`Deleting category ${code}`);
        
        const result = await categoryOperations.deleteCategory(code, description);
        if (result.success) {
          console.log(`✅ Category ${code} deleted successfully`);
          await populateCategorySelect();
          await populateCategoriesModal();
          return result;
        } else {
          throw new Error('Failed to delete category');
        }
      }
      // User cancelled
      return;
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('❌ Error deleting category:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}
```

### 2. `src/renderer.js`

**Problem**: Unnecessary `.bind()` call was causing issues:

```javascript
return categoriesInstance.deleteCategoryUI.bind(categoriesInstance)(event, code, description);
```

**Solution**: Removed the unnecessary `.bind()` call:

```javascript
return categoriesInstance.deleteCategoryUI(event, code, description);
```

## Key Changes

1. **Async/Await Pattern**: Converted `deleteCategoryUI` to use async/await for better error handling
2. **Promise-based `customConfirm`**: Now properly awaits the confirmation result
3. **Proper Error Handling**: Added try/catch blocks for better error management
4. **Removed Unnecessary Binding**: Fixed the function call in renderer.js

## Testing

Created test file `test/test-categories-delete-fix.html` to verify:

1. **customConfirm Function**: Tests the Promise-based customConfirm function
2. **deleteCategoryUI Function**: Tests the updated async/await implementation
3. **Integration Test**: Tests the complete flow to ensure no function code is displayed as text

## Expected Behavior

After the fix:

- ✅ Modal shows proper confirmation message
- ✅ No function code is displayed as text
- ✅ Delete operation proceeds when confirmed
- ✅ Proper error handling and logging
- ✅ UI updates after successful deletion

## Related Issues

This fix addresses the same pattern that was previously fixed in other modules:

- Song deletion confirmation dialogs
- Holding tank removal confirmation dialogs
- Hotkey removal confirmation dialogs

All these modules now use the Promise-based `customConfirm` function consistently.

## Verification

To verify the fix works:

1. Open the application
2. Go to Categories management
3. Click "Delete" on any category
4. Verify the modal shows the proper confirmation message
5. Confirm the deletion
6. Verify the category is deleted and UI updates correctly

## Files Created

- `test/test-categories-delete-fix.html` - Test file to verify the fix
- `doc/CATEGORIES_DELETE_FIX_COMPLETE.md` - This documentation file

## Additional Fix: Scroll Position Preservation

After the initial fix, it was discovered that deleting a category would cause the modal to lose its scroll position, making it difficult to continue managing categories if there were many of them.

### Scroll Fix Implementation

1. **Enhanced `populateCategoriesModal` function**:
   - Added `preserveScroll` parameter (default: false)
   - Store current scroll position before re-populating
   - Restore scroll position after re-population

2. **Updated `deleteCategoryUI` function**:
   - Call `populateCategoriesModal(true)` to preserve scroll position
   - Ensures user stays at the same position in the list after deletion

3. **Added CSS for proper modal scrolling**:
   - Set `max-height: 70vh` for modal body
   - Added `overflow-y: auto` for proper scrolling behavior

### Files Modified for Scroll Fix

- `src/renderer/modules/categories/category-ui.js` - Enhanced with scroll preservation
- `src/stylesheets/index.css` - Added modal body scrolling styles
- `test/test-categories-scroll-fix.html` - Test file for scroll functionality

## Status

✅ **COMPLETE** - The categories delete confirmation dialog now works correctly and displays proper confirmation messages instead of function code. Scroll position is also preserved after deletion for better user experience.
