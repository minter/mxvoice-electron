# Hotkeys File Menu Fix

## Issue Description

The "Open Hotkeys File" menu item from the application menu was not opening the file picker dialog. When users clicked on this menu item, nothing would happen.

## Root Cause

The issue was in the module dependency injection system. The `fileOperations` module was not being properly passed to the `appSetup` module during initialization.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Missing Dependency**: In `src/main/index-modular.js`, the `initializeModules()` function was not passing the `fileOperations` module to the `appSetup` module
2. **Menu Function Failure**: The menu item calls `fileOperations.loadHotkeysFile()`, but `fileOperations` was `undefined` in the `appSetup` module
3. **Silent Failure**: The function call failed silently, so no file picker dialog appeared

## Files Modified

### `src/main/index-modular.js`

**Problem**: The `fileOperations` module was not included in the dependencies object:

```javascript
function initializeModules() {
  const dependencies = {
    mainWindow,
    db,
    store,
    audioInstances,
    autoUpdater
    // fileOperations was missing here
  };

  // Initialize each module
  appSetup.initializeAppSetup(dependencies);
  ipcHandlers.initializeIpcHandlers(dependencies);
  fileOperations.initializeFileOperations(dependencies);
}
```

**Solution**: Added `fileOperations` to the dependencies object:

```javascript
function initializeModules() {
  const dependencies = {
    mainWindow,
    db,
    store,
    audioInstances,
    autoUpdater,
    fileOperations  // Added this line
  };

  // Initialize each module
  appSetup.initializeAppSetup(dependencies);
  ipcHandlers.initializeIpcHandlers(dependencies);
  fileOperations.initializeFileOperations(dependencies);
}
```

## How the Fix Works

1. **Dependency Injection**: The `fileOperations` module is now properly passed to the `appSetup` module
2. **Menu Function Availability**: The `loadHotkeysFile()` function is now available when the menu is created
3. **File Picker Dialog**: When users click "Open Hotkeys File", the file picker dialog will now open correctly

## Testing

Created test file `test/test-hotkeys-file-menu.html` to verify:

1. **Module Dependencies**: Tests that `fileOperations` is properly passed to `appSetup`
2. **Menu Function**: Tests that the `loadHotkeysFile` function exists and is callable
3. **Mock File Operations**: Tests the complete flow with mocked dependencies

## Expected Behavior

After the fix:

- ✅ Clicking "Open Hotkeys File" from the menu opens a file picker dialog
- ✅ The dialog shows `.mrv` files by default
- ✅ Users can select and load hotkey files
- ✅ The hotkeys are properly loaded into the application

## Related Menu Items

This fix also affects other menu items that depend on the `fileOperations` module:

- "Save Hotkeys To File" (Command+S)
- "Open Holding Tank File"
- "Save Holding Tank To File"

All of these should now work correctly since the `fileOperations` module is properly available.

## Files Created

- `test/test-hotkeys-file-menu.html` - Test file to verify the fix
- `doc/HOTKEYS_FILE_MENU_FIX_COMPLETE.md` - This documentation file

## Status

✅ **COMPLETE** - The "Open Hotkeys File" menu functionality now works correctly and opens the file picker dialog as expected.
