# Testing Framework Setup Summary

## 🎉 What We've Accomplished

We have a **robust Playwright + Electron** test framework with **strong per‑suite isolation** and **CI‑ready diagnostics/cleanup**.

## 📁 Project Structure (UPDATED)

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1) Per‑Suite Isolation (each test file)
- ✅ Each suite launches the app with a unique `userDataDir`
- ✅ Inside that directory: `db/`, `music/`, `hotkeys/`, and `config.json`
- ✅ Suite DB is copied from the canonical seeded DB into `db/mxvoice.db`
- ✅ Suite music is copied from `tests/fixtures/test-songs/` into `music/`
- ✅ App runs with `E2E_USER_DATA_DIR=<suite userDataDir>` (fully isolated)
- ✅ Diagnostics print the suite paths and file listings at launch

### 2) Cleanup and Safety
- ✅ Global teardown deletes all per‑suite artifacts under `tests/fixtures/suites/`
- ✅ Per‑suite `test-user-data*` directories are also removed
- ✅ Real app data is never touched

### 3) Electron App Testing
- ✅ Real app UI assertions (no mocking of Electron)
- ✅ Deterministic Electron binary via `executablePath`
- ✅ CI‑friendly with artifacts, traces/screenshots, and optional retries

- ✅ **Audio format support** - MP3, MP4, M4A, WAV, OGG, FLAC, AAC

### **Holding Tank System**
- ✅ **Storage vs. playlist modes** - Mode switching, behavior differences
- ✅ **Tab management** - 5 tabs, renaming, isolation, persistence
- ✅ **Drag & drop** - Song reordering, cross-area transfers
- ✅ **File operations** - Load/save holding tank files (.hld format)
- ✅ **Context menus** - Right-click operations (Play, Edit, Remove)

### **Hotkey Management**
- ✅ **Hotkey assignment** - Drag songs to F1-F12 keys
- ✅ **Tab isolation** - Separate hotkey sets per tab
- ✅ **Persistence** - Save/load hotkey files (.hky format)
- ✅ **Operations** - Clear, rename tabs, remove songs

### **User Interface & Experience**
- ✅ **Core layout** - All major UI regions and controls
- ✅ **Responsive design** - Window resizing, element positioning
- ✅ **Modal systems** - Add song, edit song, preferences, bulk operations

## 🔧 How It Works (UPDATED)

### Suite Lifecycle (per file)
```javascript
import { _electron as electron, test, expect } from '@playwright/test';
import { launchSeededApp, closeApp } from '../utils/seeded-launch.js';

let app, page;

test.beforeAll(async () => {
  // Creates unique userDataDir with db/music/hotkeys inside it,
  // copies seeded DB and songs, logs the paths, and launches the app.
  ({ app, page } = await launchSeededApp(electron, 'my-suite'));
});

test.afterAll(async () => {
  await closeApp(app);
});

test('example', async () => {
  await expect(page.locator('body')).not.toBeEmpty();
});
```

## 🎯 What We're Testing

### **Electron App Features**
- ✅ App Launch & Window Management
- ✅ UI Elements and structure
- ✅ User Interactions (menus, context menus, keyboard)
- ✅ Seeded flows (search, add/edit/delete songs)

### **Test Structure**
- **`unseeded/first-run.spec.js`** — First‑run flow (no pre‑seeded DB)
- **`seeded/*`** — Feature suites against seeded data
- Manual: **`smoke.spec.js`** — Basic boot verification (excluded from default runs; use `yarn test:smoke`)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### **1. Install Playwright**
```bash
yarn test:install
```

### **2. Run Tests**
```bash
# Tests launch your app automatically!
yarn test:smoke
```

### **3. View Results**
```bash
yarn test:report
```

## 🔍 Development Workflow

### **Writing Tests**
```javascript
import { _electron as electron, test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test.describe('Feature Tests', () => {
  let app, page;

  test.beforeAll(async () => {
    app = await electron.launch({ args: ['.'] });
    page = await app.firstWindow();
  });

  test.afterAll(async () => {
    await app.close();
  });

  test('should work', async () => {
    // Test your app's UI
    await expect(page.locator('button')).toBeVisible();
  });
});
```

### **Debugging Tests**
```bash
# See browser during tests
yarn test:headed

# Interactive test runner
yarn test:ui

# Debug mode
yarn test:debug
```
