- **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT create documentation unless explicitly instructed to do so
- Documentation should only be generated when the user specifically requests it
- Do not automatically create READMEs, guides, or usage docs for routine code changes
- When documentation IS requested, follow these rules:
  - All generated documentation must be placed inside the `doc/` directory
  - Use clear file names like `doc/SETUP.md`, `doc/USAGE.md`, etc.
  - Do not place documentation elsewhere in the project

- You do not need to write documentation for every task, but when you do, follow these rules
- All generated documentation (including READMEs, guides, and usage docs) must be placed inside the `doc/` directory.
- When creating or updating documentation, do not place it elsewhere in the project.
- Use clear file names like `doc/SETUP.md`, `doc/USAGE.md`, etc.
